## TL;DR 
A proposal is being put together to run a BoF session on Notebooks (i.e. discussions on Jupyter and myBinder but if this is too narrow a scope please say so) at 
[RDA Helsinki](https://www.rd-alliance.org/rda-14th-plenary-helsinki-espoo)
which will run from 23rd-25th of October.
The deadline for the proposal is the 27th June. 

If you are interested in getting involved, attending the meeting or have suggestions for discussion topics, then please either email

## Introduction
Notebooks, specifically Jupyter notebooks (but also notebooks based on Rmarkdown) are generating a great deal of excitement and are potentially a significant step forward in terms of reproducibility, education, code documentation and academic publishing. A recent [paper](www.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf) found nearly 1.2 Million unique notebooks just going through github.

More recently the deployment of sites such as [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), [myBinder](https://gke.mybinder.org/) and [EGI notebooks](https://notebooks.egi.eu/hub/login) mean that notebooks can be deployed on a cloud and hence obviates 
issues with installed libraries. One potential result of this is that it would represent the easiest pathway for users to use 
cloud computing resources for research which could transform the use
of such resources. It is important that initiatives such as EOSC become more
aware of such initiatives at a policy level. 


## Proposal 
Details of how to apply for a BoF can found [here](https://www.rd-alliance.org/14th-plenary-bof-session-application-form). The application is itself relatively short though it's worth looking carefully at the criteria that are set. It's important to make sure it matches the RDA's mission and that it's not simply a set of talks but that there's room for discussion. 


## Possible discussion points for BoF

The following are a set of possible topics that could be discussed at the BoF. There probably is time to discuss 


### Notebook citation
Given the profusion of notebooks it is clear that a system of enabling the citation of notebooks needs to be implemented. In many respects this 
represents an opportunity as the infrastructure behind notebooks is comparatively new and 
hence potentially easily adapted to follow citations guidelines for 
the [Force 11 software citation implementation group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group) and the [software source code Interest Group](https://rd-alliance.org/groups/software-source-code-ig) citation group
in the RDA.

### Influencing policy 
The EGI already successfully deployed a notebook solution. Can the functionality of Binder be similarly deployed? How do notebooks fit into the 
EOSC vision and other similar platforms? If not what steps can be made to influence thinking in this area. 

### Software engineering and notebooks
A valid criticism of notebooks are that it encourages poor software 
engineering practice such as TDD or encapsulating the notebooks into libraries. Some of this stems from the fact that notebook editors 
are nowhere near as developed as other IDE's but the first concerns are genuine. What steps can be taken to improve this situation?
